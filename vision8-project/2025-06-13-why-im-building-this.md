This summer, Iâ€™m building Vision8 â€” a vision testing and "tracking" app that runs entirely on a mobile device.

Iâ€™m making a tool I wish my grandmother could have used.  
She struggles with her eyesight and finds modern apps confusing.  
Vision8 will be so simple and intuitive that even someone with low tech literacy can track their eyesight like they track their weight.

## ðŸŽ¯ My goal

To make vision testing as easy and routine as stepping on a scale.  
To give people a number they can watch over time.  
To turn blurry eyesight into a signal, not just a feeling.

---

## ðŸ§  Why now?

Because this matters.  
Because I want my skills to be useful to people I love, and people Iâ€™ve never met.
